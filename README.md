# SIT AND LISTEN - Interactive Experience about Privacy and Security
inspiration: the little theatrical scenes from Kentucky Route Zero supplement games

Room in 3D, you’re sitting on an armchair. There is a choice in front of you (Tell your story) (Wait for a better time). When you press (Tell your story) a knock on the door is heard and a slim man enters the room.

Words you speak into the microphone appear.

Man: ‘I brought the recorder’
You: ‘Good’
Man (taking a seat): ‘You sure you want to do this?’
You: ‘I already made my choice haven’t I? Just sit and listen'
Man (nods and sets up the tape recorder)
You: 'One day, I decided to go looking for an elusive creature, known to me as civilisation.' 
You: 'Even though I knew what the state of the outside world was at the time I ventured out'

I'd heard so much about this wondrous, prolific being and yet I could not tell you what it looks like, or who it is. Is it male, female, big, small, tall, short? Yet I felt like I knew so much about it whilst knowing nothing at the same time. I didn't know where to start, I sat in my bed at two in the morning pondering; where might I find this creature of concealment. I decided, that week; I would get to the highest points in the city, and try to find this beast, civilisation. I eventually saw it, so old, yet young. rugged, travel worn and beaten. It looked as if it had seen many storms in it's life time. But how could I converse with it. It's stone and cement skin seemed so impenetrable. I could not see a mouth for it to speak. It seemed to have eyes everywhere, but how could I see what it sees, how could I explore it's memories.

I felt like a pirate artist. Rouge, misanthropic motherfucker. Connected to the world, both physically and through the net. Billions of computers, trans-ocean cables, extension satellites, wireless systems, the neural network of the world.

Our main delights are comfort and work, but no work under authority or necessity of another. That may have been in the past but we are not living in the past, we are living now. it is fair that some have more than others, but there should be no man with none. there are three to whom I pledge allegiance; chaos, life and death. 

Creating a world without boundaries is a task of abstract proportions. Those proportions in turn lie upon foundations of the abstract structure. It is an expansion of the rigid tracks around which we swirl the wips of a story. The abstract attaches us and forces into an internal discussion.



Holding paper of a failed company I realised there is something off.


3. "We should try and push enlightenment ideals, but not the old ones, new ones."

"Can't allow modern media corporations to control our perceptions of reality, because it's not a realistic picture of reality. Each of us own little windows into reality and with the internet we can put that together to paint a real image of the world we live in and who we are. But the large media companies, are painting a picture that manipulates us into going into the direction that they want us to go in, our direction is something that we should decide together, rather than by a small minority who's direction is based purely on what will give then a better lively hood."

4. "Offer a deal to mod the cultural, subversive back lash against spying revelations, creating instability in our collective civilisation. Think of it as a radical, subversively viral cultural injection."







I want to be committed to having an online presence. I want to be a free individual. I want to contribute 
to the collective culture of the world, in my own little way. I don't expect anything great, but I'm going to put every fibre of my being into giving you all something which I have made to the best of my capabilities. I have been through many hard-ships though I claim nothing spectacular, there others with difficulties that far out strip my own. That, however does not stop them being challenging. I dealt with everyone step by step, never by my own. I believe in individual strength, but I believe that know one can really do everything by themselves. The only reason human civilisation came as far as it did, was because we all puled together and worked as a team, to create the world that we wanted to see. 

Laws of publishing boundaries in Scotland
Media institutions that are connected with power, i.e companies, governments and military

When I'm using so many resources to think and to what what the other person is thinking, then I am not using my
resources productively where as; if we make the commitment to do something together, then we remove the paranoia
between us, with our mutual goal. 
Scotland needs to focus on working with people, instead opt trying to spy on them and control them




stoic calm



If you want to know life you must first meet chaos, 
and to know death you must first know life, 
and to meet death is to know life.
I found Chaos a long time ago, we have spent many a year together, been through many experiences, both painful and pleasant. He taught me to live for what I can see in the horizon and not beyond. This book, my creation, comes to you through extreme adversity, with death in constant pursuit, I tenaciously bequeath this creative piece to you, the world."

A book with no one author to stay in coffee shops for ever. I will publish the new addition every year around the world as of ******* providing there is consistent financial support. Offer a deal to mod about a cultural, subversive back lash against spying revelations, creating un-stability in our collective civilisation. radical subversive viral cultural injection 

the danger is when a war only protects a very small pocket of society and the masses are led through media to believe that the war is a necessity

"give me a place to stand, " said archimedes, "and I will move the earth.
now with the internet you all have a voice, and you all exercise it.
but now you have a voice try find something useful to share.
Ideas want to be together.
People forming a group is like thoughts forming. The society isn't aware that they are there but they might be able to 'feel' their presence but the 
world at large will not know their existence until the fruit of their efforts has materialised. Into say for example a building.  

******** ABSTRACT NARRATIVE NOTES 

This reminds me of the Screener Walls project I was thinking about earlier. Player is the anti-anti-establishment and the establishment is telling the actual truth. The player is surrounded with propaganda of the truth. Shouts of equality are supposed to be quenched by him. He is the anti-hero. 

Creating a world without boundaries is a task of an abstract nature. As it is built it first lies upon foundations of the structural - an expansion of the rigid tracks around which we swirl the wips of a story.
